This command is one of the **image template commands**, meaning that the bot will send an image that is related to the word of the command, so this command will send an image of an anime girl with a smile on her face going to get a test with very low marks. An example can be found here: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/728756333150470195/733436710205259937/image0.jpg> (message link if you don't want to open your web browser: <https://discordapp.com/channels/728750698816340028/728756333150470195/733436713799647283>).

You can also specify text to output along with the command. The bot will say any specified text and attach the image along.

**Examples**:

* `{prefix}bad_grades`: Sends the image without any text
* `{prefix}bad_grades Test`: Sends the image with the text `Test`
* `{prefix}bad_grades "Test"` Sends the image with the text `"Test"`
