This command is one of the **image template commands**, meaning that the bot will send an image that is related to the word of the command, so this command will send an image of a pillow with the caption `let my soul frickin ascend`, an example of which can be found here: <https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/728750699294490697/734912774496321547/20200720_192937.jpg> (message link if you don't want to open your web browser: <https://discordapp.com/channels/728750698816340028/728750699294490697/734912780917932135>).

You can also specify text to output along with the command. The bot will say any specified text and attach the image along.

**Examples**:

* `{prefix}ascend`: Sends the image without any text
* `{prefix}ascend Test`: Sends the image with the text `Test`
* `{prefix}ascend "Test"` Sends the image with the text `"Test"`
