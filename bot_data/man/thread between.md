Similar to `{prefix}thread above`, but only shows the comments in-between the top and bottom comments, including the top and bottom comments themselves.

Arguments:
* `top`: The link to a comment on Reddit, or the Base36 ID of the comment.
* `bottom`: The link to a comment on Reddit, or the Base36 ID of the comment.

The base 36 ID can be found in the last part of the url. In this URL: `https://www.reddit.com/r/Catswithjobs/comments/in8x2j/never_wears_a_mask_always_demanding_more_and_more/g46dndt`, the comment Base36 ID is `g46dndt`.

Example: `{prefix}thread between https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/inlm8f/pope_gossiping_is_plague_worse_than_covid/g487771 https://www.reddit.com/r/nottheonion/comments/inlm8f/pope_gossiping_is_plague_worse_than_covid/g48kt6r`
